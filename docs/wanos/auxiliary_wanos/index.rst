  Utilizing ASE technology, this **WaNo** joyfully converts a geometry file easily from format **A** 
  to **B**. And, even better, it cleverly solves the problem of the missing unit cell information in `xyz` files 
  by creating a cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter 25% larger than the maximum distance between atoms, making 
  it a breeze to add a unit cell to `xyz` files.
